Python in 30 Days – Day 2

A simple Python project to practice core Python data types and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions.

What I used

Python

Lists & Dictionaries

Booleans

Conditionals (if / else)

GitHub Actions (CI pipeline)

What it does

The script day-2.py creates an in-memory task list using Python list and dict, updates task status, and uses conditionals to check progress.
It also demonstrates mutability by showing how changes to one reference affect the original list.

Automation

Every time I push code to GitHub, GitHub Actions automatically runs the Python script and marks the build as success or failure.
