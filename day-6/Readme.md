Day 6 – Modular Python Project with Docker

Overview
This project demonstrates **modular Python programming**, clean separation of concerns, input handling, and basic business logic. It is structured to be both **developer-friendly** and **CI/CD-friendly**.

---

🧠 What This Project Does
- Separates business logic from helper utilities
- Handles user input cleanly
- Coordinates execution through a single entry point
- Works in both interactive environments and automated pipelines

---

📁 Project Structure
- `core/` – business logic
- `core/logic.py`
- `utils/` – helper functions (formatting, messages)
- `utils/helpers.py`
- `main.py` – entry point that coordinates core and utils

---

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.11
- Docker
- Modular code structure
- CI-friendly input handling (GitHub Actions compatible)
