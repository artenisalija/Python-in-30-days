Day 1 – Python Basics & CI Automation

Overview
This repository is part of my **30-day challenge** to improve my **Python** and **DevOps** skills by building and automating small, real-world scripts.

Each day is organized in its own **folder** (`day-1`, `day-2`, etc.) to clearly track progress and learning over time.

🧠 What Day 1 Does
Day 1 includes a Python script that prints:
- The Python version
- The operating system
- Environment variables

---

⚙️ CI/CD Automation
The script is **automatically executed** using **GitHub Actions** whenever code is pushed.

When code is pushed:
1. GitHub checks out the repository
2. Runs `python --version`
3. Executes the Python script
4. Displays the output in the **Actions** tab on GitHub

🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
