📘 Python in 30 Days — DevOps & Python Practice

This repository is my 30-day challenge to improve my Python and DevOps skills by building and automating small real-world scripts.

Each day is committed to its own Git branch (day-1, day-2, etc.) to track progress and learning.

🧠 What Day 1 Does

Day 1 contains a Python script that prints:

Python version

Operating system

Environment variables

The script is automatically executed using GitHub Actions when code is pushed.

⚙️ Tech Used

Python

Git & GitHub

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

🚀 How It Works

When code is pushed to a branch:

GitHub checks out the repository

Runs python --version

Runs the Python script

The output is visible in the Actions tab on GitHub.
