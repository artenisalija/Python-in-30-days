# Task Processor – Python + CI/CD

This small project was built to practice how real backend and cloud systems handle errors safely.

## What I learned

### 1. Custom Errors
I created my own error called `InvalidTaskError` so the program can clearly say when a task is invalid instead of using generic Python errors.

### 2. Validation (Pure Function)
The validation function only checks data and returns a result.  
It does not print, log, or change anything. This makes it easy to test.

### 3. Logging (Side Effects)
When something goes wrong, a logging function writes the error into a file (`errors.log`).  
This is how real systems keep records of problems.

### 4. Graceful Error Handling
The program does not crash when a task is invalid.  
It catches the error, logs it, and returns a clean message instead.

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
A GitHub Actions pipeline runs tests every time code is pushed.  
If errors are not handled correctly, the pipeline fails.  
This prevents broken code from being merged.

## Why this matters
This is how professional backend and cloud systems (like AWS services) are built:
- clear errors
- safe handling
- automated testing
- reliable deployments
