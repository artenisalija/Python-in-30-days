Python Day 3 Challenge

This repository contains daily Python exercises, organized in separate folders for each day. Each file represents the solution for that day’s task.

Structure & Purpose

Each day is a separate folder with a Python file.

The goal is to build practical Python skills incrementally.

Automation Logic

On every commit to main, a GitHub workflow runs all Python files to ensure they execute without errors.

Only runtime errors are checked; style or formatting is ignored.

If a file fails, the workflow highlights exactly which file has an issue.

Daily Use

Add new files in the corresponding day folder.

Push to GitHub; the workflow automatically validates the code.

This ensures continuous daily practice with instant feedback on execution.
