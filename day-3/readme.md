Day 3 – Automation

Automation
- On every commit to `main`, a **GitHub Actions workflow** runs all Python files  
- Only runtime errors are checked; style and formatting are ignored  
- If a file fails, the workflow highlights which file has an issue

---

Daily Use
- Add new files in the corresponding day folder  
- Push to GitHub  
- Workflow automatically validates code

This ensures continuous practice with **instant feedback** on execution.
