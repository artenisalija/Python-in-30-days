Day 9 – Unit Testing with Docker & CI/CD
What I did

Created a simple Python function.

Wrote a test for the function to check whether it passes or fails.

Testing with Docker

I don’t have pytest installed locally, so I used Docker.

Inside the Docker container:

Installed pytest using pip install pytest

Ran the tests using CMD: pytest

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Created a GitHub Actions workflow that:

Builds the Docker container

Runs the container

Fails the pipeline if the tests fail

Passes the pipeline if the tests succeed

Improvements

Fixed the Day 7 workflow so that:

Every Dockerfile pushed to the repository is automatically built and run

Technologies Used

Python

Pytest

Docker

GitHub Actions
